# Download, fork or directly link to this interface in your em_control gem file
#* Bundle install

# Add the example interface logic code as a dependency
#* Actual name: Flexible demo
#* Module name: Interface
#* Class name: FlexiInterface
#* Filename: flexible_interface.rb
#* Click Save
# Create a new Control System (name it what ever)
# Create a new Controller logic mapping
#* Link the control system to the dependency you just added

If the control system is not already running just start it:

* rake control

If the control system is running do the following:

# press the tilda key anywhere in the dashboard: ~
# Click the console to give it focus
# Login to the control system
